  <h2>Saving coral through sugarcane</h2>

  <br>

  <h4>If information is power, the Great Barrier Reef has an unlikely formidable ally.</h4>

  <br>

  <p>
    Combining the clever use of data with automation, the Internet of Things (IoT) Smart
     Irrigation System aims to reduce runoff to the reef and adjacent coastal wetlands.
      On top of this, farmers could be tasting sweet success with higher yields for minimum effort.

    Stunning coral isn’t usually the first thing that springs to mind when you visit a sugarcane farm, 
    but for JCU’s Dr Eric Wang, the two are connected. His vision of a smart irrigation system has him pumped 
    for the future of agriculture and the Great Barrier Reef.

    “We have a large farming industry in Australia, but we also have a reef to protect,” Eric says. 
    “The main benefit of the IoT Smart Irrigation System will be the reduction of runoff that damages 
    the reef. The system will also have other benefits, including saving time and using a scientifically proven model.”

  <h2>Automation is a game-changer</h2>

  <br>

  <p>
    To assist with scheduling irrigation events, the farmer used a sugarcane crop model. The sugarcane crop model
     uses information, such as soil type, planting dates and local weather data to calculate the daily water
      usage of each crop. From this information, the farmer was then able to determine the timing and volume
       of water to be applied to each field. However, this required the farmer to interact with two independent
        tools and manually transfer irrigation information from the automation software to the crop model. In 
        a typical year, this farm has more than 1,000 separate irrigation events, making the information transfer
         a time consuming and tedious task.
